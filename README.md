#№ 👋 Hello everyone! 🌟

🚀 I am a backend developer specializing in Python, working with frameworks like **Django**, **FastAPI**, and **Flask**. I also have experience with databases (such as **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**  and others), and I’ve developed **Telegram bots** and **APIs**. 

🔧 With an engineering background, I have previously worked as a design engineer, which has equipped me with a strong technical foundation.

🌟 I prefer practices like **Docker** packaging and **CI/CD**. I strive for clean and elegant code, as well as full test coverage. I’m open to collaboration! 🤝
